A study tested whether cholesterol was reduced after using a certain brand of margarine as part of a low fat, low cholesterol diet. The subjects consumed on average 2.31g of the active ingredient, stanol easter, a day. This data set contains information on 18 people using margarine to reduce cholesterol over three time points. The data set can be used to demonstrate paired t-tests, repeated measures ANOVA and a mixed between-within ANOVA using the final variable ‘Margarine’. The dataset is also good for discussion about meaningful differences as the difference between weeks 4 and 8 is very small but significant
