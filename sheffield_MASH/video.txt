This dataset was collected by Scott Smith (University of Sheffield) to evaluate the use of best method for informing the public about a certain medical condition. There were three videos (New general video A, new medical profession video B, the old video C and a demonstration using props D). He wanted to see if the new methods were more popular so collected data using mostly Likert style questions about a range of things such as understanding and general impressions. This reduced dataset contains some of those questions and 4 scale scores created from summing 5 ordinal questions to give a scale score.
