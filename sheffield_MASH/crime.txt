This data set gives a variety of variables by US state at two time points 10 years apart. A variety of regressions and t-tests can be carried out with the main scale dependent being and Crime Rate (offences per million population) and t-tests with the independent being whether or not the state is in the south. Mostly discrete variables as they measure populations per 1000, there are some continuous variables such as those measuring expenditure.
