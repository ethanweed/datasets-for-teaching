# datasets-for-teaching
A collection of freely-available datasets for teaching statistics. To be updated as I find new and useful datasets. My plan is to not only link to the datasets, but to also host copies of them here, so that students can easily read the data directly into their analysis scripts. I plan to include attribution links, so that these can be traced back to the source that I have cloned them from, but I may also modify the datasets, according to my own pedagogical purposes, so these data are for demonstration purposes only, and should NOT be treated as actual, raw data.
